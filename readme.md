# fMRI Independent Components (ICs) Labeling Tool

Overview

The fMRI Independent Components (ICs) Labeling Tool is designed to help users label independent components from resting-state fMRI data, determining whether they are signals or noise. This labeling aids in the denoising process of fMRI data. The user-friendly interface allows efficient classification and saving of labeling results.

## Features

The tool includes the following main components:

- **Image Display Area**: Displays three images of the IC, including spatial images and associated time-series plots.
- **Slider**: Located below the images, allows for quick navigation between ICs.
- **Button Area**: Provides options to select a folder, save labels, navigate between images, and label ICs.
- **Label Results List**: Displays the labeled ICs and their status (Pass or Fail).

## Installation

To use the tool, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local environment:
    
    ```
    git clone <repository_url>
    Run ICs Labeling Tool.exe on Windows 
    
    ```
    

## Usage

### 1. Select Folder

- Click the **"üìÅ Select Folder"** button in the top left corner to choose a folder containing IC images.
- The selected folder should be the output folder generated by FSL's ICA decomposition tools, such as [MELODIC](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/MELODIC) or [ICA-AROMA](https://github.com/rhr-pruim/ICA-AROMA). This folder typically contains a subfolder named **"report"** that stores images for each IC. Each IC will have three types of images:
    - `f{index}.png`: Spatial image generated from the component, representing the brain's activation map.
    - `t{index}.png`: Time-series plot corresponding to the temporal dynamics of the component.
    - `IC_{index}_thresh.png`: Thresholded spatial map that highlights significant areas of activation within the component.

### 2. Browse Images

- After selecting a folder, images will be displayed in the three labels on the left side of the interface.
- Use the **"‚èÆÔ∏è Previous"** button or slide the **Slider** to navigate between ICs.
- The current IC index and progress (e.g., "Labeling IC 5/150") will be displayed above the images.

### 3. Label ICs

- Use the buttons below to label each IC:
    - **"‚úÖ Pass"**: Click if the IC is a signal.
    - **"‚ùå Fail"**: Click if the IC is noise.
- Once labeled, the tool automatically moves to the next IC.

### 4. Save Label Results

- After labeling, click the **"üíæ Save Labels"** button to save the results in the selected folder.
- Labels are saved as a **label.txt** file in JSON format.

### 5. View Label Results

- The labeled results will appear in the **Label Results List** on the right, showing the index and status (Pass or Fail) of each IC.

## Quick Operation Guide

- **Quick Navigation**: Use the slider to jump to a specific IC.
- **Image Zoom**: The image display area supports scrolling and zooming for detailed viewing.

## Status Bar

- The **Status Bar** at the bottom of the tool displays messages like successful label saving to keep you informed of the current operation status.

## Important Notes

1. **Image File Format**: Ensure the images are named and formatted correctly as per FSL's output, or they may not load properly.
2. **Maximum Number of Images**: The tool currently supports labeling up to 150 ICs.
3. **Saving Labels**: Always save your labels after completing the labeling process to avoid data loss.

## Troubleshooting

- **Images Not Loading**: Verify the folder path is correct and the images are named appropriately.
- **Slider Not Working**: Ensure a folder is selected and the IC images are properly loaded.
